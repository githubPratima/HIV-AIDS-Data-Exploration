# HIV-AIDS-Data-Exploration
HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is the virus that attacks the human immune system. If it is not treated properly, it can progress to AIDS. Once the HIV virus enters the human body, it becomes a lifelong disease. While there is no perfect medicine to completely cure it, medication can help mitigate the effects of the virus. Study shows that late 1800 this disease jumped from Chimpanzee. 

Over the years, it has spread across Africa and has subsequently disseminated throughout the world. In the United States, it was first observed in the mid-1980s. HIV, the virus associated with AIDS, has emerged as one of the most significant global health and developmental challenges since its initial documentation in 1981. Approximately 39 million people worldwide are living with HIV, and tens of millions have died due to AIDS. These statistics align with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), adopted in 2015, which aim to end the AIDS epidemic by 2030 as part of SDG Goal 3: "ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages."
To gain a deeper statistical understanding, I am conducting exploratory data analysis on HIV data obtained from UNESCO and WHO.
